This is a python script that takes a css file as an argument and creates a cross-browser-compatible css file (in the same directory as the original).
If you use a CSS3 element that is not cross-browser supported, this script will recognize it, and automatically fill in the code for all browser versions of the element name.
Presently it supports box-shadow, border-radius, transform and column-count.
Soon I'll add support for linear and radial gradients.
