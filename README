This is a python script that takes a css file as an argument and creates a cross-browser-compatible css file (in the same directory as the original). Just drop the css file onto this script, and let the magic happen.
If you use a CSS3 element that is not cross-browser supported, this script will recognize it, and automatically fill in the code for all browser versions of the element name.
Example:
If your css file has a line:
"border-radius:4px;"
The outgoing file will have:
"border-radius:4px;
-moz-border-radius:4px;
-webkit-border-radius:4px;"
If your file already contains cross-browser support, this script will create a lot of redundant lines. (So don't do that.)
Presently it supports box-shadow, border-radius, transform and column-count.
Soon I'll add support for linear and radial gradients.
